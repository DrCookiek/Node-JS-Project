# BizCards - Server

## Description

This is a server built with node.js. For managing business cards. It includes various user and card management features like logging in and registering users.

## Install

1. Download the project.

2. Open new terminal and in the command line write the command:

```
npm i
```

to install all the required libraries.

3. Change the "env.example" file to ".env" and enter the various variables (if needed). Delete the variables which are not needed.
   Default values for various variables, used in the project, can be found under config->default.json.

4. In the end, after doing all that, you can write in the command line:

```
npm run dev
```

for development purposes,

or

```
npm run start
```

for production.

## Seeding DB

Under the folder called "scripts" there is a file called "dbSeeder.js". This file seeds the DB of 3 different users (regular, business and admin) and 3 different cards. The 3 cards are connected to the business user.

In order to run this file, write in the command line:

```
npm run seed-db
```

Important information:

- The seeding process empties both collections (users and cards) before inserting the data.
- The seeded data can be changed in file called scripts->dbSeederData.js.
- Users and cards can be added, but all the cards will be connected to the last user un the array. For right functionality, he should be a Business user ("isBusiness": true), but not a admin ("isAdmin": false).

## Usage

The first table is "User Routes".

The second table is "Card Router".
